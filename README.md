# buildingDockerImages
This repository holds files which has been used to describe three ways of building Docker images.

# The 3 ways are the following:
1. Building Docker image with a normal build
2. Building Docker image with multi-stages build
3. Building Docker image from a jar file

# Usage
- For normal build check the Dockerfile unde "buildingDockerImages/buildFromDockerfile/"
- For multi-stages build check files under "buildingDockerImages/multiStagesBuild/"
- Use files under "buildingDockerImages/buildFromPackage/" to build from a jar file
